cultural theme: latin in general that includes ancient latin, french, portugese, italian, romanian and spanish.

appearance: anthropomorphic foxes with plantigrade legs, both their fur and hair can come in many variety of colors, their eye color is always grey.




things the project definitley needs
- 0% revisioned armor sets, cuz the armor doesnt make any sense
- 0% npc settlements
- 0% a custom ship for them
- 0% their own themed furniture and stuffs present for crafting or their settlements
- 0% unique codexs, due to how most of them are good with literature
- 0% race trait support
- 0% more planet info support, to know there are any beluan taurikin inhabitants of the planet

progress of the project: 0%

things the project probably maybe needs:
- ⁂ a hostile faction
- ⁂ unique weapons
- ⁂ an fu patch with their settlements spawning on fu planets
- ⁂ a unique intro mission
 
"⁂" = not implemented yet
"∫" = implemented
